## COLD Features

Is based on the shape context descriptor. In a nutshell, we pick points from the contours of the shape, we then construct a set of vectors between the point pi and all other n-1 points, we then build a histogram based on the relative coordinates  between  pi  and the n-1 other points. COLD further uses dominant points; such as straight, angle-oriented features and curvature over contours of handwritten text components.
